## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to make sure a file is closed after using it
- What is and how to use the `with` statement
- What is JSON
- What is serialization
- What is deserialization
- How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string
- How to convert a JSON string to a Python data structure
- How to access command line parameters in a Python script

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files must end with a new line
- All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- All test files should be text files (`.txt` extension)
- Tests should be executed using: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules must have documentation
- All classes must have documentation
- All functions (inside and outside a class) must have documentation
- Documentation must be a real sentence explaining the purpose (length will be verified)

**Tip:** Collaborate on test cases to cover all edge cases.
