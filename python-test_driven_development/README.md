# Python Test Driven Development

## Background Context

**Important notice on intranet checks for Python projects:**  
Starting from today:
- Always write documentation (modules + functions) and tests *before* coding.
- Intranet checks for Python projects will not be released before the first deadline, to encourage TDD and thorough case consideration.
- Collaborate on test cases to cover all edge cases, but implement them individually.
- Never trust the user—always consider all possible edge cases.

## Resources

Read or watch:
- [doctest — Test interactive Python examples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html) (until “26.2.3.7. Warnings” included)
- [doctest – Testing through documentation](https://realpython.com/python-doctest/)
- [Unit Tests in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What an interactive test is
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- Basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files must end with a new line
- All test files must be inside a `tests` folder
- Test files must be text files (`.txt` extension)
- Run tests using: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules and functions must have documentation
- Documentation must be a real sentence explaining the purpose (length will be checked)
- Collaborate on test cases to cover all edge cases

**Remember:** Focus on TDD—write your documentation and tests first!
