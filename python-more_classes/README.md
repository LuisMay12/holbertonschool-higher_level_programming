# Python - More Classes and Objects

## Resources

Read or watch:

- **Object Oriented Programming** (Read everything until the paragraph “Inheritance” (excluded))
- **Object-Oriented Programming** (Read only: “General Introduction,” “First-class Everything,” “A Minimal Class in Python,” “Attributes,” “Methods,” “The `__init__` Method,” “Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding,” “`__str__`- and `__repr__`-Methods,” “Public- Protected- and Private Attributes,” & “Destructor”)
- [Class and Instance Attributes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables)
- [classmethods and staticmethods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#classmethod)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property) (Mainly the last part “Public instead of Private Attributes”)
- [str vs repr](https://realpython.com/python-str-vs-repr/)
