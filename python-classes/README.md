# Python - Classes and Objects

Welcome to the **Python - Classes and Objects** project! This project introduces you to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It is essential to read and experiment with all the recommended resources to fully understand the concepts.

## Resources

Read or watch the following, in order:

- [Object Oriented Programming](https://python-course.eu/oop/object-oriented-programming.php) (Read up to "Inheritance" excluded)
- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/) (Read: General Introduction, First-class Everything, A Minimal Class in Python, Attributes, Methods, The `__init__` Method, Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding, Public, Protected, and Private Attributes)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://python-course.eu/oop/properties-vs-getters-and-setters.php)
- [Learn to Program 9: Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGyBuVCTeE)
- [Python Classes and Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp)
- [Object Oriented Programming](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- What is OOP
- What does “first-class everything” mean
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- Difference between a class and an object/instance
- What is an attribute
- How to use public, protected, and private attributes
- What is `self`
- What is a method
- What is the special `__init__` method and how to use it
- Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- What is a property
- Difference between an attribute and a property in Python
- Pythonic way to write getters and setters
- How to dynamically create new attributes for existing instances
- How to bind attributes to objects and classes
- What is the `__dict__` of a class/instance and its contents
- How Python finds attributes of an object or class
- How to use the `getattr` function

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files must end with a new line
- First line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`
- All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation (docstrings)
- Documentation must be a real sentence explaining the purpose

## More Info

**Documentation is mandatory!**  
Each module, class, and method must contain a docstring using [Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).

Experiment, test, and play with OOP concepts to deepen your understanding!
