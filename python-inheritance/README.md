## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:
- What is a superclass, base class, or parent class
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When an instance can have new attributes
- How to inherit a class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherits from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by inheritance to subclasses
- The purpose of inheritance
- When and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files: `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory
- Code must follow `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable
- File lengths will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files must end with a new line
- All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`
- Test files should be text files (`.txt` extension)
- Tests executed with: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules, classes, and functions must have documentation
- Documentation must be a real sentence explaining the purpose (length will be checked)
- Collaboration on test cases is encouraged

### Documentation
- Do not use the words `import` or `from` inside comments

This project covers the fundamentals of inheritance in Python, including single and multiple inheritance, method overriding, and the use of built-in functions related to class hierarchies.
